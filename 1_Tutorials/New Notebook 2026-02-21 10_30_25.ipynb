    "Everyone, please pay close attention to this Section.\n",
    "This is one of the most important Sections in Data Structures and Algorithms.\n",
    "In your future:\n",
    "•\tYou will solve 200, 300, 400+ DSA questions\n",
    "•\tYou will repeatedly use lists, sets, and dictionaries\n",
    "•\tYou will perform operations like:\n",
    "o\tadd\n",
    "o\tdelete\n",
    "o\tinsert\n",
    "o\tsearch\n",
    "o\titerate\n",

    "Now here is the key point most students ignore:\n",
    "Writing correct code is not enough.\n",
    "You must know the time complexity of every operation you use.\n",
